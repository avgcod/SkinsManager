If you currently do not have any skins in the folder you can create the necessary structre using the Create Structure button.
The folder structure for skins is completely customizeable. It simply expect the top folder to be the type, the sub folder to be the sub type and the sub folders in there to be the different skins.
For example: Skins Location -> Area -> Forest -> Blue Forest.
The above example would show up in the program as there being a skin type Area with a sub type Forest and an available skin Blue Forest.
The folders can be renamed.
The program expects the folder structre and files to match what is in the game location.
For example if you rskins folder has a data folder with a forest.png in it, the program with try to put the forest.png file in the data folder in the game location folder.
You must select a skin before you can click the Apply SKin, Back Up or Restore buttons.
You have to have a back up made before you can use the Restore button.
